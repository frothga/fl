This directory contains a collection of tools I have developed over the years.
Some are scripts or simple executables, and others are C++ headers and
libraries.

The arrangement of the materials is:

bin
	Command line executables.  These are built from src/util

doc
	Documentation?  In your dreams!

include
	All the include files for the libraries.  These are in a flat directory
	structure.

lib
	The library files needed for linking.

script
	Shell scripts.

src
	Source code for everything.
	util
		These are compiled into command line executables rather than a library.
	X
		Classes that wrap X window structures.  Not intended to be a GUI
		toolkit as much as a way to access basic X using C++.
	linear
		Linear algebra classes (vector, matrix) and a bridge to LAPACK.  Not
		the most efficient matrix library, and doesn't inlcude every fancy
		memory layout, but does have a clean programming interface.
	image
		Image processing.
	net
		Stream interface to TCP sockets, plus some basic server infrastructure.
