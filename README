Contents
--------

This directory contains a collection of tools I have developed over the years.
Some are scripts or simple executables, and others are C++ headers and
libraries.

The arrangement of the materials is:

bin
	Command line executables.  These are built from src/util

html, man
	Doxygen generated documentation.

include
	All the include files for the libraries.

lib
	The library files needed for linking.

script
	Shell scripts.

src
	Source code for everything.
	base
		Simple utility classes not catagorized elsewhere.
	util
		These are compiled into command line executables rather than a library.
	X
		Classes that wrap X window structures.  Not intended to be a GUI
		toolkit as much as a way to access basic X using C++.
	numeric
		Linear algebra classes (vector, matrix) and a bridge to LAPACK.  Not
		the most efficient matrix library, and doesn't inlcude every fancy
		memory layout, but does have a clean programming interface.
	image
		Image processing.
	net
		Stream interface to TCP sockets, plus some basic server infrastructure.


Building under GNU systems
--------------------------

Unlike the typical library distribution, this one has no configure script.
Instead, you must edit the file Config to point to all the external
dependencies.  Typically, it is sufficient to set the value for
LIBRARYNAME_DIR, as the other values will be derived from it.  After you
have edited Config to your satisfaction, run "make" or "make install" at
the command line.


Building under Microsoft Visual Studio
--------------------------------------

Open the "fl.sln" solution file, and then build it.  :)  The external
dependencies that normally come with a GNU style distribution are prebuilt
and stored in the directory "mswin".  You will need to include this
directory in your link path when building an application.
