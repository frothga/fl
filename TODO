TODO
----

* Sparse matrices using contigs rather than linked lists.
* Add MatrixBlock which consists of pointers to MatrixAbstract at each cell.

* Add leading dimension and start address to Matrix template.  This will allow it to deliver submatrices directly, and to return shorter matrices from functions like gelss without copying.  This would fully implement the matrix representation implied by LAPACK.
* Add MatrixStrided with both rowStep and columnStep.  This can implement dense transpose matrices.

* Add a separate start address from memory block base in PixelFormatPacked.  This would allow ROI style processing.

* Ability to return directory of metadata tags from ImageFile.
* Error trapping in ImageFileFormatJPEG.

* Improve image cache mechanism: store multiple types and scales.  Create new class to manage caching, and add interface to take it instead of image.  Make static cache shared by all image processors.  Make it TLS if possible.  Sources that currently do caching:
		DescriptorCombo.cc
		DescriptorLBP.cc
		DescriptorOrientationHistogram.cc
		DescriptorSIFT.cc
		DescriptorTextonScale.cc
* Use scale pyramid in HarrisLaplacian and Hessian.  Need to finish image cacheing to do this is in the nicest fashion.

* Replace PixelFormat::precedence with comparison operators.  Base comparisons on bit-capacities for respective channels.

* Optimize ConvolutionDiscrete2D in a manner similar to 1D (ie: factor out main case and corner cases).
* SSE optimizations for ConvolutionDiscrete1D.

* Hunt down memory error in CanvasImage::drawText() and companions.  Also, after using setFont() for a while, ceases to work.  Probably related.
* Create true MetricEuclidean and rename current one to ComparisonEuclidean.
* Add FLSB generic web server to net.
* Deepen template specialization for bool, to get rid of warnings in MSVC.
* Make filters simple to use on large images without loosing performance on small images.
* Consider adding hint back into video out interface, and use it to guide selection of format when underlying codec supports several.
* Fix Image::bitblt() to handle arbitrary packed pixel formats by treating rows in an ROI as opaque lines of bytes.
