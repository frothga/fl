TODO
----

* Sparse matrices using contigs rather than linked lists.
* In lapack.h, change destroyA to preserveA, and make default false (destroy unless asked to preserve).
  - Change callers in old 3d software from PhD.

* Ability to return directory of metadata tags from ImageFile.

* Use scale pyramid in HarrisLaplacian and Hessian.

* Replace PixelFormat::precedence with comparison operators.  Base comparisons on bit-capacities for respective channels.

* Optimize ConvolutionDiscrete2D in a manner similar to 1D (ie: factor out main case and corner cases).
* SSE optimizations for ConvolutionDiscrete1D.

* Hunt down memory error in CanvasImage::drawText() and companions.  Also, after using setFont() for a while, ceases to work.  Probably related.
* Create true MetricEuclidean and rename current one to ComparisonEuclidean.
* Deepen template specialization for bool, to get rid of warnings in MSVC.
* Make filters simple to use on large images without loosing performance on small images.
* Consider adding hint back into video out interface, and use it to guide selection of format when underlying codec supports several.
* add color to Convolution1D, BlurDecimate, and DoubleSize (maybe Decimate too)
* use BlurDecimate filter in KLT (study if BlurDecimate is doing more harm than the speed gain merits)
