TODO list for adapting fl to VC++:

socket.cc -- needs some code conditioned on use of Winsock.  There are subtle differences of behavior that require workarounds in linux, specifically w.r.t. waiting for packets to arrive/leave.  The standard send and recv functions in Winsock behave in the way I prefer (best recollection), but linux requires using the poll function to get the same behavior.  The current socket.cc is written for linux.

cluster.h -- uses pthreads and sockets.  Will probably write a thin pthread wrapper around Win32 threads, unless someone has already written one and it is free.  Currently exlcuding all clustering code (Agglomerate.cc ClusterMethod.cc Kmeans.cc KMeansParallel.cc Kohonen.cc) in vc project to avoid compile errors.

fix warnings for <bool> matrix classes.  IE: add more methods to MatrixBool.tcc.

rewrite ImageFileFormatJPEG and ImageFileFormatTIFF to use windows native codecs, if they exist.  Currently exluding these files from build.

things to test in image:
- SIFT values (changed histogram indexing code)
- color histograms (changed bracketing code)
- YUV related pixel formats (changed pointer manipulation) (seems to work OK under cygwin, still should check under msvc)
